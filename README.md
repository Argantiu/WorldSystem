## About
WorldSystem is a plugin where every player can get a world. There they can build, play and do anything they want without creating stress in a single world. The world owner can also add other players and manage their permissions on his world like is he allowed to build, teleport or changing his gamemode.

When a player creates a new world you can also set a template which will then be cloned.
